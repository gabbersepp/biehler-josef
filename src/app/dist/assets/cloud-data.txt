C#;I am developing applications with C# since 2011. During the last years, I've done a lot to improve my skills. 
Bugs;Beside producing new bugs, I like to analyze and fix the hardest one. There's nothing better than fixing a weird bug after doing many investigations. Every time fixing a weird bug, you have learned something new and you feel like being god!
Performance (C#);During developing applications with C# I was often encountered with performance issues. So I learned to fix them. IL code and Assembler is something you should be familiar with when doing performance investigations.
CIL;Years ago I started with Assembler. That helped me a lot understanding .NET IL code. That is crucial sometimes when analyzing performance issues
ASM;Yeah I loved Assembler and I think I'm still loving it. 2020 I started again with ASM in order to write a .NET profiler with C++ and ASM.
OS;If you ever need a new operating system whose capabilities are very limited but is very very cool, you can take a look at my own OS, called BiehlOS. Written in Assembler!
Performance (SQL);If you use SQL, you can do many things wrong. We also have done so much wrong that our application's performance was deteriorating slowly. That was the beginning of a very interesting and never ending journey through many technical guides regarding SQL in general and MS SQL Server.
JS;I am loving JS because of it's simplicity. Things that have to be done very laborious in C# can be solved so easily with JS. While first I was not a JS fan, I now doing many things with JS. Especially small "microservices" or build tasks can be built extremely fast.
TS;No JS without TS. I love C# with it's typesystem but sometimes I wish, C# would adopt the duck typing of Typescript. Very helpful!
Aurelia;That is what we use currently at work for our frontend.
React;React was love at first sight. Many of my private projects that require a UI are based upon React.
Pen & Paper;Sometimes I draw directly on my Surface Tablet, sometimes I use paper. Not sure which medium I would prefer.
Drawing;2019 I started to learn drawing cartoons. I like their simplicity which makes it easy to express an idea. Also I noticed that cartoons can also be used for headers of blog posts and so on. When drawing my images on my own, I have no problems with copyright. Very clever!
Affinity Designer;My favorite tool for doing vector graphics on the PC. Seems to be similar to Adobe Illustrator but much cheaper.
Clip Studio Paint;This is my favorite tool for drawing on my MS Surface Tablet. Before I owned that software, I used "Leonardo" app. But Clip is way better.
Java;Well, I know how to code in Java. My last big Java project I worked in was some kind of marketplace.
Big O;Know the difference between n^3 and nlogn. You don't? Then take a look at "Big O".
C++;2020 I started again with C++. Goal: Writing a .NET profiler. Very nice language. Surely something I want to do more in the future.
Cypress.io;One of several modern testing frameworks. I also contributed to their github repositories. 
SQL;Optimizing a slow query starts not in the execution plan. 
Trainee;Performance analysis in the first year of school? Finding objects in memory dumps before you even know what objects are made off? If this sounds like something you want to do, the come to our team as trainee.
